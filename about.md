My name is David and I'm an aspiring data scientist with a background in journalism and information technology. My current life consists of pursuing a master's in Data Science at the [University of Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at/){:target="_blank"} while working in the field. In particular, I'm curious about the intersection of technology and society, data visualization, digital privacy, machine learning and algorithm theory.

Due to a personal connection, I also have a strong interest in levering technology to easy blood sugar management for diabetics. In particular, I recently built an [R shiny app](https://github.com/hanny-bal/diabetes-analytics){:target="_blank"} for unsupervised pattern recognition in glucose data and a [Gnome tool](http://localhost:4000/2022/10/31/dexcom-glucose-tray.html){:target="_blank"} that displays CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) data in real-time.

Whenever I'm not engaged in technology, you can usually find me behind a book – I'm an avid reader with a soft spot for philosophy and classic German literature – working on my calisthenics skills, learning Russian or writing.

## What about this blog?
With vague goals, this blog aims to be everything and nothing. It is and will be technical writing, data science and short essays. Solving problems and peeks of inspiration. So I hope it serves its purpose. Thanks for coming and take care!
