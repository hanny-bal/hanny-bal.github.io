Hi! I am a researcher in Spatial Data Science with the [Geosocial Artificial Intelligence](https://it-u.at/en/research/research-groups/geosocial-ai/){:target="_blank"} group at the [Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria (IT:U)](https://it-u.at/en/){:target="_blank"}. I work on novel machine learning methods for analysing geo-referenced social sensing data.

My interests consist of an interdisciplinary mix of data science, machine learning, geoinformatics and classic computer science. Previously, I have worked in data science, journalism and software development. I am curious about pretty much everything.
