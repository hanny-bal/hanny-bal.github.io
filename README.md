# 🌐 Personal website
This is my barebones website based on [LittleLink](https://littlelink.io/), a straightforward Linktree alternative that is based purely on HTML on CSS.

To adapt this website for your own ourposes, simply download the template from the website and adapt the `index.html` page.

Custom buttons can be built using the [LittleLink Button Builder](https://builder.littlelink.io/).
