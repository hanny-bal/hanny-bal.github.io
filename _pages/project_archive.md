### Certifications
Being the curious mind I am, I have acquired a few online certifications to expand my skillset:
- [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/6ZF2ZDA8TC3X){:target="blank"}
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/david_hn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures){:target="blank"} 
- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/david_hn/responsive-web-design){:target="blank"} 

I also completed the follwing courses that do not come with a certificate but are highly recommended for anyone interested in data journalism:
- [R for Journalists](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/){:target="blank"}
