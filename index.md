Hi! I am a researcher in Spatial Data Science at the [Geosocial Analytics Lab](https://geosocial.at/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at/){:target="_blank"}. I work on new methods for modeling and analyzing geo-social media data.

My interests consist of an interdisciplinary mix of data science, machine learning, geoinformatics and classic computer science. Previously, I have worked in data science, journalism and software development. I am curious about pretty much everything.
